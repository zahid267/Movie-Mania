## USER STORY 
* As a User who is Bored and in the mood to watch a movie 
* I Would love to open the Movie- Mania application as a registered user 
* so i can search for movies based on their different genres, get information 
 about them such as date of production and characters involved.
* So i can find the one that i'm interested in to either save for later or watch.
